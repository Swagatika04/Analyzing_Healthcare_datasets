## **Asthma ED Visits**

#### **Introduction**

This dataset contains counts and rates (per 10,000 residents) of asthma (ICD9­CM, 493.0­493.9) emergency department visits among California residents by County and age group (all ages, 0­17, 18+). The data are derived from the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development emergency department databases. These data include emergency department visits from all licensed hospitals in California. These data are based only on primary discharge diagnosis codes (ICD9­CM). NOTE: Rates are calculated from the total number of Asthma ED Visits (not the unique number of individuals).
